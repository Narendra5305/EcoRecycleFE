        </p>
  
        <div className="steps-container">
          <Step title="Sign Up and Log In" icon="üìù">
            Start by <strong>registering</strong> or <strong>logging in</strong> to your EcoRecycle account. This allows you to manage your scheduled pickups, track your recycling history, and earn rewards for your efforts.
          </Step>
  
          <Step title="Schedule Your Pickup" icon="üóìÔ∏è">

            <ul className="step-list">

              <li>Choose your pickup location and preferred date and time for the collection.</li>
              <li>Our system will confirm availability and send you an instant pickup confirmation.</li>
            </ul>
          </Step>
  
          <Step title="Prepare Your E-Waste" icon="üì¶">
            Before the scheduled pickup:
            <ul className="step-list">
              <li>Pack your e-waste safely and securely in a box.</li>
              <li>Ensure that devices are properly prepared (remove batteries, wipe data where necessary).</li>
            </ul>
            You will receive a reminder notification 24 hours before the scheduled pickup.
          </Step>
  
          <Step title="Pickup and Verification" icon="üöõ">

              <li>Verify the items you have listed for recycling and collect them for safe disposal.</li>

          </Step>
  
          <Step title="Safe Recycling Process" icon="‚ôªÔ∏è">
            After collection, your e-waste will be sent to certified recycling centers where:
            <ul className="step-list">
              <li>Devices and components are dismantled, sorted, and recycled in compliance with environmental standards.</li>
              <li>If applicable, data on devices will be securely wiped to ensure privacy.</li>
            </ul>
          </Step>
  
          <Step title="Earn Green Points" icon="üèÖ">
            For every e-waste pickup, you‚Äôll receive Green Points that you can use for:
            <ul className="step-list">
              <li>Discounts on future pickups.</li>
              <li>Contributions to eco-friendly initiatives.</li>
